# Upgrading

## 1.x to 2.x

No real BC breaks, but 2.0 marks a major version because of the new requirement to specify
explicitly the correct version of the Elasticsearch SDK (`elasticsearch/elasticsearch`)
for the version of Elastic Stack you are using. It also, at the same time, allows usage of
the major version 7 of these projects.
